# given two integer variables a and b, and a boolean variable flag.the task is to check the status and return accordingly. return true for following cases:
#1.either a or b is non-negative and flag is False 2.both a and b is negative and flag is true. Otherwise return false.
class Solution:
    def checkStatus(self, a, b, flag):
        # code here
        if ((a >= 0) ^ (b >= 0)) and (flag == False):
            return True
        if (a < 0 and b < 0) and (flag == True):
            return True
        return False
